SQL Assignment - Key Insights and Solutions

I recently completed an SQL assignment provided by Satisha Dhawale, where I worked with a dataset to extract meaningful insights using SQL queries. This assignment helped me strengthen my SQL skills, including filtering, aggregating, and joining tables to derive useful business insights.

🔍 Key Insights Extracted:
Retrieved books by genre, publication year, and stock availability.
Analyzed customer locations and order history.
Calculated total revenue and identified best-selling books.
Found the most expensive and least stocked books.
Determined top-spending customers and cities with high book sales.
